# Dissertation-analysis

This repository contains many of the scripts I used to analyze data for my dissertation. 

These scripts have been updated somewhat since my dissertation was printed because I have been working on a manuscript for publication.

The raw neural data is not included in this repository because the files are too large.

To run the basic analysis, run the script "stdscripts.m".
